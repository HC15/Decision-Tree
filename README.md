# Decision-Tree
Implementation of decision tree learning algorithm with information gain heuristic and variance impurity heuristic

Uses reduced error post pruning algorithm to help prevent overfitting


# To Run Code
python main.py <training-set> <validation-set> <test-set> to-print:{yes,no} prune:{yes, no}

<training-set> is the path of the training set csv file

<validation-set> is the path of the validation set csv file

<test-set> is the path of the test set csv file

Replace to-print with either yes or no, depending on whether or not want to print Tree

Replace prune with yes or no, depending on whether or not you want to prune Tree
